# BrowserLight
BrowserLight is a .NET 8 Blazor WebAssembly project that allows users to create a web app for displaying a plain color of their choice in their browser. This can be particularly useful in situations where additional lighting is needed for webcam setups, and monitors displaying a browser are readily available.

## Usage
See the web app in action [here](https://brimerland.github.io/showstuff/BrowserLight/).

Select the color you want to display by using the color picker which appears if you click or tap on the screen.

## Features
**Customizable Color:** Users can select the color they want to display on their screen. Just click or tap on the screen to get access to the color picker.

**Webcam Lighting:** BrowserLight can be used as a makeshift lighting solution for webcam setups when no additional lighting is available.

**Blazor WebAssembly:** Built using Blazor WebAssembly, this project is a client-side web application, which means it runs entirely in the browser.
